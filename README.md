# LODModS
The Legend of Dragoon Modding System (LODModS) is a set of tools designed for modding The Legend of Dragoon, as well as a framework designed for creating and installing patches.

Please note that this is a currently incomplete work in progress, so bugs are possible. Currently, only modules for handling config files and working with discs/game files, along with the command line interface, are included. Modules such as text dumping/insertion will be added later once code is complete and documented. Please report on LoD discord (https://discord.gg/rQWXgK5) or at theaerialzamboni@gmail.com with full error log if encountering an error.
